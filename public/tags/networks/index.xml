      <description>iAmAlive Script iAmAlive script confirms if a host is reachable and triggers a collaborative action via Tropo; Tropo will send an sms to the network admin if the host is reachable or call the network admin if the host is unreachable.
The idea is to demonstrate the capabilities of APIC-EM 1 as well as Tropo APIs and how they can be leveraged on to facilitate collaboration within distributed teams.</description>

This model adopts the SIP protocol as signaling to set up a call and MPLS as a core network forwarding mechanism. SIP over MPLS will provide an alternative to SIP over dedicated Internet Access (the current and more typical deployment approach).</description>
