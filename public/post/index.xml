      <description>As you become more invested in your websites and web apps, you will probably want to add more client-side functionality and reactivity to them. Modern web development typically achieves this through the use of front-end frameworks. In this post, I explore the use of Flask and Vue to build a web app using Jinja templates.

      <description>A list of good reads I believe every Engineer should read through in striving to be a better Engineer. Will likely organize these better down the line.

Books Apollo How to do a bunch of “ambitious” things with lots of talented folks and quickly at that! Here’s a fantastic video presentation on the Apollo Guidance Computer(AGC). Some fun facts:
 AGC didn’t have room for code to enforce invariants AGC first human interactive interface AGC first priority scheduler   My favourite titbits: Engineers reported to engineers, metrics deck/project deck used to coordinate decentralized organization.</description>

      <title>iAmAlive Script ( APIC-EM &amp; Tropo API )</title>

      <description>iAmAlive Script iAmAlive script confirms if a host is reachable and triggers a collaborative action via Tropo; Tropo will send an sms to the network admin if the host is reachable or call the network admin if the host is unreachable.
The idea is to demonstrate the capabilities of APIC-EM 1 as well as Tropo APIs and how they can be leveraged on to facilitate collaboration within distributed teams.</description>

      <title>The Internet Of Things [ IoT ]</title>

      <description>Internet of Things – a conjunction of three simple words that form an invisible yet supporting realm that coexists in the shadows of our dimension. If you have lived through the 80s and/or the 90s, you might have co-experienced the advent and “rise-to-power” of the internet. You might also be able to recall how you loved (or hated) to establish a dial-up internet connection over your telephone line and would shriek with sheer joy (if you got an acceptable connection rate) or despair (if your connection was as slow as snail mail).</description>

      <description>Wilber O. Wanjira1 and Juma O. Kevin2 Principal Engineer - Integration1 and Senior Engineer - Core Planning (Voice)2  Introduction In this document, we share the deployed network architecture to provide SIP over MPLS. This model adopts the SIP protocol as signaling to set up a call and MPLS as a core network forwarding mechanism. SIP over MPLS will provide an alternative to SIP over dedicated Internet Access (the current and more typical deployment approach).</description>
